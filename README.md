# Projeto_Webscraping-API-1
This is my first webscraping and API project!

This project has the intent to:

1) Through the use of The Open Weather Map API, retrieve Brazilian Cities Weather Information. More informations about the API can be found here: https://openweathermap.org/api

2) Through webscraping, retrieve information of the Receita Federal website using CNPJ's to get public informations from the 11 top fintechs in Brazil. However, the RF website blocks more than 3 requests from the same IP, therefore, I had to reduce the search for 3 CNPJ's only. I used the URL: https://www.receitaws.com.br/v1/cnpj/{CNPJ}, substituting {CNPJ} for que real CNPJ code.
